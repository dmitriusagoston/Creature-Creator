# Creature Creator
Creature Creator is a Python-based project that employs genetic algorithms to evolve unique creatures based on defined environmental conditions. This project utilizes JSON files to store creature and environment data, allowing users to customize parameters and observe the evolution of diverse and adaptable creatures.

## Features

- **Genetic Algorithm Implementation**: Utilizes genetic algorithms to evolve creatures based on fitness functions and environmental factors.
- **JSON Data Storage**: Creature and environment data are stored in JSON files for easy customization and modification.
- **Fitness Function Definition**: Defines fitness functions to evaluate the performance of generated creatures in their respective environments.
- **Creature Visualization**: Provides visualization tools to observe the characteristics and behaviors of evolved creatures.
- **Configurability**: Offers flexibility in adjusting genetic algorithm parameters and environmental conditions to generate a wide range of creature variations.

## Usage

To use the Creature Creator, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using Git:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/dmitriusagoston/Creature-Creator.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**: Change your current directory to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd Creature-Creator
    ```

3. **Run the Program**: Execute the `main.py` file to start the Creature Creator:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

4. **Follow the Prompts**: Once the program is running, follow the prompts in the terminal to tailor the genetic algorithm process. You'll be prompted to choose options related to creature and environment data, fitness function customization, and other parameters.

5. **Visualize Results (Optional)**: Use the stable diffusion submodule to visualize the newly created creatures.

6. **Experiment and Explore**: Feel free to experiment with different options and parameters to generate a diverse range of creatures and observe their behaviors in different environments.
